Exercise 1.12.  The following pattern of numbers is called Pascal's triangle.

     1
    1 1
   1 2 1
  1 3 3 1
 1 4 6 4 1

The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it. Write a procedure that computes elements of Pascal's triangle by means of a recursive process.




item 1  = line 1
item 2  = line 2
item 3  = line 2
item 4  = line 3
item 5  = line 3
item 6  = line 3
item 7  = line 4
item 8  = line 4
item 9  = line 4
item 10 = line 4

(define (pascal line item)
    (cond ((or (= item 0)
               (= item line)) 1)
          ((or (< item 0)
               (> item line)) 0)
          (else (+ (pascal (- line 1) (- item 1))
                   (pascal (- line 1) item)))))
